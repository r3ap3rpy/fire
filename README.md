This repository holds demo files for my course on skillshare and udemy on the [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) module.

All you need to do install the module with pip and you can run the demos.

```bash
pip install fire
``` 

The demos are written for python3.* so some correction might be needed for older like python2.* environments.
